# doclight

A PDF scanning app that does not suck.

There are plenty of other apps out there that can create PDFs using images captured from a device camera. Many of them have advanced features like automatic cropping and contrast adjustment. However, these features can sometimes be annoying &mdash; especially when they get things wrong. (No, auto-crop, the focus of this image is not the lower-left corner!) Doclight dispenses with all of these fancy value additions to deliver the core, simple experience of "take pictures -> have PDF" without any unnecessary frills.

The goal is not to compete with other, feature-rich scanning apps; it is to deliver an alternative experience for people who don't need or want all those features.
